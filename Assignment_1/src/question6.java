/*Question 6:
A quadrilateral with at least one pair of parallel sides
is called a trapezoid or trapezium.
The area K of a trapezoid is given by K = h * (a + b)/2,
where a and b are the lengths of the parallel sides, h
is the height (the perpendicular distance between
these sides). Write a program that takes input lengths
of two parallel sides and the perpendicular distance
between these two parallel lines, and prints the area
of this trapezoid. (Image Reference:

special cases. The orange figures also qualify as parallelograms.) */
