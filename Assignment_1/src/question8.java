/*Question 8:
Area of a triangle can be calculated if lengths of its three sides is known
by using the Heron’s formula which says that Square root of
(s(s−a)(s−b)(s−c)) where s is half of the perimeter of the triangle that
can be calculated by adding length of all the three sides and then
dividing it by 2.(for further information suggested resource is
